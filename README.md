I've always been a huge cricket fanatic. I used to read a lot of cricket commentary and i still do, not just for the match updates, but because some of the commentary was pure gold. The way commentators slip in crazy idioms, excellent phrases, and just the perfect words at the perfect time always amazed me.  

At some point, I thought why not make AI do that based on my prompt?  
This project is my attempt at that. I'm scraping all match commentary from Cricbuzz using Playwright and then gonna train a deep learning model (probably Transformers or LSTM) to generate catchy captions, tweets, or memes inspired by real cricket commentary.  

The goal? To teach an AI that understands the game, picks up on those mind-boggling expressions, and generates one-liners that feel just as electric as live commentary.  

Right now, I'm focused on getting the data and next step, I'm gonna making it talk.
